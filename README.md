# Monte Carlo Option Pricing

This project implements Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of European and path-dependent options. It includes price path simulation using Geometric Brownian Motion and discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure.

## 📌 Features (Planned)
- European Call/Put pricing
- Path simulation via GBM
- Vectorized Monte Carlo
- Asian & Barrier options
- Performance comparison vs Black-Scholes
- (Optional) C++ acceleration

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/run_pricing.py
```
